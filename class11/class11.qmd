Q13
```{r}
file<-read.table("SNP.txt")
GG<-file[file$geno=="G/G",]
summary(GG)
AG<-file[file$geno=="A/G",]
summary(AG)
AA<-file[file$geno=="A/A",]
summary(AA)
```
GG has 121 samples with a median expression level of 20.074.AG has 233 samples with median expression of 25.065. 
AA has 108 samples with a median expression level of 31.25. 

Q14
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(file,aes(geno,exp,color=geno))+geom_boxplot()
```
Q14) Based off this boxplot, it appears that the A/A genotype has higher overall expression of
ORMDL3 compared to the G/G genotype. The SNP effect appears to affect expression of ORMDL3

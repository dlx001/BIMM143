Q1) The star tells it to run the program with everything that ends with .faa.gz so 
it will run on all 3 files that we just downloaded

Q2) 6530 
command: grep -c ">" mouse.1.protein.faa

Q3) it will just print the first two DNA sequences to the console
Q4) it copies it twice to the file
Q5) grep -c ">" mm-second.fa
Q6) The -r tag is the recursive tag, it is to copy everything in the directory. The asterik 
is to tell it to copy everything in the work directory

```{r}
b<-read.table(file = "C:/Users/danie/Downloads/mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv", sep = '\t', header = FALSE) 
colnames(b)<-c("qseqid", "sseqid", "pident", "length", "mismatch", "gapopen", "qstart", "qend", "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore")
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(b, aes(pident, bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) 
```
```{r}
ggplot(b, aes((b$pident * (b$qend - b$qstart)), bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) + geom_smooth()
```
